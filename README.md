### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Abdelmoniem Hassan and I am a third year Computer Engineering student at McMaster University.

I have spent the last year working at RBC Captial Markets working on a pricing and risk analytics financial library.
Most of my experience is in C++, and Python. I am also familiar with Java.

I will be spending the fall, and winter terms at McMaster completing my third year of studies and expect to graduate in summer '24.

I am open to summer '23 opportunities!
